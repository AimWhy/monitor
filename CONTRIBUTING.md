# Contibuting

## Setting up an Enviroment
To run the test suite and our code linter, node.js and yarn are required.

[`node` download](https://nodejs.org/download)
[`yarn` download](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)


`v2.0.0`we use `lerna` to manage them.

```
$ yarn
$ yarn lerna bootstrap
$ yarn build
```

With that, the repo is fully set up and you are ready to run all commands
